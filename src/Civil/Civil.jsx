    {/* Introduction */}
    <div className="text-xl mb-6">
      Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and natural built environment. This includes infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water supply systems, and waste management facilities. Civil engineers ensure the safety, functionality, and sustainability of these structures by applying principles of mathematics, physics, and material science.
