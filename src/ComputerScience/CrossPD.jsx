          Cross-platform mobile development is an approach that allows you to build a single mobile application that runs seamlessly on multiple operating systems. In cross-platform apps, some or even all of the source code can be shared. This means that developers can create and deploy mobile applications that work on both Android and iOS without having to rewrite the code for each platform.
