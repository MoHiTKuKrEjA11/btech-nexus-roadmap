    Cross-Platform Mobile Development: <br /><br />
    Cross-platform mobile development is an approach that allows you to build a single mobile application that runs seamlessly on multiple operating systems. In cross-platform apps, some or even all of the source code can be shared. This means that developers can create and deploy mobile applications that work on both Android and iOS without having to rewrite the code for each platform. <br /><br />

    Frameworks Available for Building Cross-Platform Apps: <br /><br />
  </div>
  <div>
    1: React Native: <br />
    React Native, developed by Facebook, allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It provides a set of components for building the UI and enables developers to use a single codebase for both Android and iOS apps. <br /><br />
  </div>
  <div>
    2: Flutter: <br />
    Flutter, developed by Google, is an open-source UI software development kit that allows developers to create high-performance, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language. <br /><br />
  </div>
  <div>
    3: Kotlin Multiplatform: <br />
    Kotlin Multiplatform, created by JetBrains, enables developers to share code between multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and desktop applications. It allows you to write platform-specific code only when necessary, leveraging shared logic for most of the app. <br /><br />
  </div>
  <div>
    4: .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI): <br />
    .NET MAUI is a cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to create native apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows with a single codebase using C#. It is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms and offers enhanced performance and flexibility. <br /><br />
